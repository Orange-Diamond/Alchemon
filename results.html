        <h3>Carrie Carter</h3>
        <img src="images/carrie.gif">
        <p>Carrie is a small cat-like Alchemon with small pointed ears, blue eyes, and a long tail. It is said that Carrie's DNA possesses the genetic composition of every existing Alchémon species, thus allowing it to use all known Alchémon moves. Its posession of every Alchémon's DNA also allows it to de-evolve.</p>

        <h3>Chris Golden</h3>
        <img src="images/chris.gif">
        <p>Tough in demeanor, Chris was raised by the rock people. He's as stubborn one of them, and as dense as them too. Give him a challenge and he'll smash his way through it. Give him a rock.... and he'll chew it. <br> 
            Dont let his tense stance fool you, because Chris is gentle by nature.</p>

        <h3>Antreo Pukay</h3>
        <img src="images/antreo.gif">
        <p>Well, I'm a fire sign so watch out! Where I come from there's lots of hostile beasts, so it pays to keep a low profile. Although I'm not naturally aggressive, I can produce flaming spines from behind when I turn to run. If I get provoked further I can unleash a torrent of fire that includes smoke which allows me to escape. I have a vegetarian diet which helps fuel my explosion of fire! Kapoosh! This also allows me to stay warm and cook my dinner in the cold dreary winter.</p>
