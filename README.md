# Alchemon
Alchemon is a web app game that lets you pit your Alchemon creatures against the TA's creatures. When you start the game, you meet Prof. Marty, and choose your Alchemon! Go into the Battle Gym and choose your TA to fight against. Be careful!!! you only have three lives.

When you die, your score will take it's place on the leader board, where you can check the scores of others, if they have played, or read about us!

**PREPARE FOR BATTLE!!!!!!**
